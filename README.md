Packages used:
pandas, sklearn, numpy, stats, scikit-learn, xgboost, boruta, scipy, matplotlib, mats, nptdms, statsmodels, ssqueezepy and hurst.

-----------
Instructions: The code should be run in consequtive order. "07_Feature_Selection_Functions.py" is the main code, and contains the different feature selection methods used. It requires datasets of features and damage states to work. These are computed in earlier codes.
Note that it is expected that "04-05_Time-Freq_feature_extract.py" will take over a day to run.
